# Final Project Report

## 1. Project Overview
This project presents an AI-based system designed to automate end-to-end web
application testing using natural language instructions. The system enables users
to describe test scenarios in plain English, which are automatically converted into
executable browser automation scripts.

The primary goal of the project is to reduce manual testing effort and make test
automation accessible to non-technical users.

## 2. Summary of Milestones

### Milestone 01: Problem Definition and Design
In this milestone, the problem of manual test case creation was analyzed. A modular
system architecture was designed to convert natural language instructions into
automated test cases.

---

### Milestone 02: Implementation
This milestone focused on implementing the core system modules, including the NLP
parser, test case generator, executor, and report generator. A clean and modular
code structure was achieved.

---

### Milestone 03: Testing and Validation
The system was tested using sample natural language inputs. Automated test scripts
were successfully generated and executed, validating the correctness of the system.

---

### Milestone 04: Final Submission
This milestone consolidates all project components, documentation, and results into
a complete and well-structured submission.
