# Implementation Details

## 1. Overview
This milestone focuses on the implementation of the AI-based automated testing system.
The system is implemented using a modular architecture to ensure clarity, scalability,
and ease of maintenance.

Each module is responsible for a specific task in the overall workflow, starting from
interpreting user instructions to executing test cases and generating reports.

---

## 2. Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Backend Framework: Flask
- Automation Tool: Playwright (Python)
- Natural Language Processing: Rule-based NLP parsing
- Frontend Input: HTML form (sample)

---

## 3. Module-wise Implementation

### 3.1 UI Layer
The UI layer provides an interface for the user to enter natural language test instructions.
It forwards the input to the backend for further processing.

**Responsibilities:**
- Accept test instructions
- Send input to the workflow controller

---

### 3.2 NLP Parser Module
The NLP Parser module processes the natural language input provided by the user.
It identifies key actions such as navigation, input, clicks, and validations.

**Responsibilities:**
- Parse user instructions
- Extract actionable steps
- Convert text into structured commands

---

### 3.3 Test Case Generator Module
This module converts the structured commands generated by the NLP parser into
Playwright-compatible Python test scripts.

**Responsibilities:**
- Generate Playwright test code
- Handle browser actions
- Insert assertions for validation

---

### 3.4 Test Executor Module
The Test Executor module runs the generated Playwright scripts in a headless browser
environment and monitors the execution.

**Responsibilities:**
- Execute automated test cases
- Capture execution status
- Handle runtime errors

---

### 3.5 Report Generation Module
The Report Generation module collects the execution results and formats them into
human-readable test reports.

**Responsibilities:**
- Record pass/fail status
- Capture logs and execution details
- Generate structured test reports

---

## 4. Implementation Workflow
The implementation follows the sequence below:

User Input → NLP Parsing → Test Script Generation → Test Execution → Report Generation

This structured flow ensures smooth execution and easier debugging.

---

## 5. Conclusion
The implementation successfully integrates natural language processing with browser
automation to generate and execute test cases automatically. The modular design allows
future enhancements such as advanced NLP models and CI/CD integration.
